# Twitch Home Page Recreation
## (first ever project in React)

Partial twitch front-end recreation with API integration, React + Typescript (very poorly used TS due to the fact that I use :any almost everywhere, and obviously now I use proper types and interfaces everywhere, lots of flaws here that I have fixed in my work ever since)
